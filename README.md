NØNOS is a security-first microkernel implementing capability-based access control, hardware-enforced isolation, and a comprehensive cryptographic subsystem. The kernel operates entirely in RAM with zero persistent state, providing quantum-resistant security for high-threat environments. Built in Rust with careful unsafe code management and extensive hardware security integration.

**Design Philosophy**: *"Security through mathematical certainty, not obscurity. Privacy as a fundamental architectural principle."*

**NØNOS MICROKERNEL** - *One mission = Defending digital freedom.*

*"In a world where privacy is under constant attack from both state and corporate actors, NØNOS stands as a foundation for digital rights - where security is not an afterthought, but the fundamental architectural principle upon which all else is built."*
